If the feet are about 60 em from the buttocks, the adjustment is in the lower area of the spine. As the feet approach the buttocks, the adjustment rises up the spine.

Padmasana directs the flow of prana from mooladhara chakra in the perineum to sahasrara chakra in the head, heightening the experience of meditation. This posture applies pressure to the lower spine, which has a relaxing effect on the nervous system. The breath becomes slow, muscular tension is decreased and blood pressure is reduced. The normally large blood flow to the legs is redirected to the abdominal region. This activity also stimulates the digestive process.', 'Siddhasana directs the energy from the lower psychic centres upward through the spine, stimulating the brain and calming the entire nervous system. The position of the lower foot at the perineum presses mooladhara chakra, stimulating moola bandha, and the pressure applied to the pubic bone presses the trigger point for swadhisthana, automatically activating vajroli/sahajoli mudra. These two psycho-muscular locks redirect sexual nervous impulses back up the spinal cord to the brain, establishing control over the reproductive hormones which is necessary in order to maintain brahmacharya for spiritual purposes. Prolonged periods in siddhasana result in noticeable tingling sensations in the mooladhara region, which may last for ten to fifteen minutes. This is caused by a reduction in the blood supply to the area and by a rebalancing of the pranic flow in the lower chakras.

It is a useful alternative to other meditation asanas. The legs and hips are not rotated outwards as in the other meditation postures, rather the knees are brought to the centre.

It helps to maintain good health of the ears, eyes\\nand throat.\\nJala neti relieves muscular tension of the face and helps\\nthe practitioner to maintain a fresh and youthful appear-\\nance. It has a calming and soothing influence on the brain.\\nIt alleviates anxiety, anger and depression, removes\\ndrowsiness and makes the head feel light and fresh.\\nJala neti stimulates the various nerve endings in the nose,\\nimproving the sense of smell and the overall health of the\\nindividual. A balance is brought about between the right\\nand left nostrils and the corresponding left and right brain\\nhemispheres, inducing a state of harmony and balance\\nthroughout the body and mind. Most importantly, however,\\nneti helps to awaken ajna chakra.', 'The benefits are the same as for jala neti. In addition,\\nhowever, sutra neti can rectify the problem of deviated\\nnasal septum. If one or both nostrils are not flowing freely\\ndue either to deformed bone or fleshy outgrowths, the\\nregular friction of sutra neti causes these obstructions to\\ndisappear within a few months.']\n"
