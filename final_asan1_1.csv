It holds the trunk and head like a pillar with the legs as the firm foundation. As the body is steadied, the mind becomes calm. This steadiness and calmness is the first step towards real meditation. Padmasana directs the flow of prana from mooladhara chakra in the perineum to sahasrara chakra in the head, heightening the experience of meditation. This posture applies pressure to the lower spine, which has a relaxing effect on the nervous system. The breath becomes slow, muscular tension is decreased and blood pressure is reduced.

51,Siddhasana (accomplished pose for men),"Sit with the legs straight in front of the body. Bend the right leg and place the sole of the foot flat against the inner left thigh with the heel pressing the perineum (the area midway between the genitals and anus). Bend the left leg. Push the toes and the outer edge of the left foot into the space between the right calf and thigh muscles. If necessary, this space may be enlarged slightly by using the hands or temporarily adjusting the position of the right leg. Place the left ankle directly over the right ankle so that the ankle bones are touching and the heels are one above the other. Press the pubis with the left heel directly above the genitals. The genitals will therefore lie between the two heels. If this last position is too difficult, simply place the left heel as near as possible to the pubis. Grasp the right toes and pull them up into the space between the left calf and thigh. Again adjust the body so that it is comfortable. Sit on top of the right heel. This is an important aspect of 100 siddhasana. Adjust the body until it is comfortable and the pressure of the heel is firmly applied. The legs should now be locked, with the knees touching the ground and the left heel directly above the right heel. Make the spine erect and feel as though the body is fixed on the floor. Place the hands on the knees in jnana, chin or chinmaya mudra. Close the eyes and relax the whole body. Siddhasana may be performed with either leg 
uppermost. Many people experience discomfort due to 
the pressure applied where the ankles cross each other. If 
necessary, place a folded cloth or piece of sponge between 
the legs at this point. At first the pressure at the perineum 
may be uncomfortable to maintain, but with practice this 
will be eased.","Siddhasana directs the energy from the lower psychic centres upward through the spine, stimulating the brain and calming the entire nervous system. The position of the lower foot at the perineum presses mooladhara chakra, stimulating moola bandha, and the pressure applied to the pubic bone presses the trigger point for swadhisthana, automatically activating vajroli/sahajoli mudra. These two psycho-muscular locks redirect sexual nervous impulses back up the spinal cord to the brain, establishing control over the reproductive hormones which is necessary in order to maintain brahmacharya for spiritual purposes. Prolonged periods in siddhasana result in noticeable tingling sensations in the mooladhara region, which may last for ten to fifteen minutes. This is caused by a reduction in the blood supply to the area and by a rebalancing of the pranic flow in the lower chakras. This posture redirects blood circulation to the lower spine and abdomen, toning the lumbar region of the spine, the pelvis and the abdominal organs, and balancing the reproductive system and the blood pressure.",Siddhasana should not be practised by those with sciatica or sacral infections.,,,,,,,Beginners

The position of the lower foot at the perineum presses mooladhara chakra, stimulating moola bandha, and the pressure applied to the pubic bone presses the trigger point for swadhisthana, automatically activating vajroli/sahajoli mudra. These two psycho-muscular locks redirect sexual nervous impulses back up the spinal cord to the brain, establishing control over the reproductive hormones which is necessary in order to maintain brahmacharya for spiritual purposes. Prolonged periods in siddhasana result in noticeable tingling sensations in the mooladhara region, which may last for ten to fifteen minutes. This is caused by a reduction in the blood supply to the area and by a rebalancing of the pranic flow in the lower chakras. This posture redirects blood circulation to the lower spine and abdomen, toning the lumbar region of the spine, the pelvis and the abdominal organs, and balancing the reproductive system and the blood pressure.",Siddha Yoni Asana should not be practised by those with sciatica or sacral infections.,,,,,,,Beginners

The thumb is above the right nostril and the ring finger
above the left. These two digits control the flow of breath
in the nostrils by alternately pressing on one nostril,
blocking the flow of breath, and then the other.
The little finger is comfortably folded. When practising
for long periods, the elbow may be supported in the pahn
of the left hand, although care is needed to prevent chest
restriction. ","Technique 1 increases awareness of and sensitivity
to the breath in the nostrils. Minor blockages are removed
and the flow of breath in both nostrils becomes more
balanced. Breathing through the left nostril tends to
activate the right brain hemisphere; breathing through
the right nostril activates the left hemisphere. The long, slow, balanced breathing of stage 2 has profound effects,
calming and balancing the energies. ","Nadi shodhana is not to be practised
while suffering from colds, flu or fever. "," Breathing should be silent in all techniques of
nadi shodhana, ensuring that it is not forced or restricted
In any way.
As the ratio and duration increases, the breath becomes
very light and subtle. Increased ratios and breath duration
should not be attained at the expense of relaxation, rhythm
and awareness. The flow of breath must be smooth, with
no jerks, throughout the practice. ","Physical - on the breath and the counting.
Mental - it is easy for the mind to wander during nadi
shodhana. Simply be aware of this wandering tendency of
the mind while continuing the practice and the count.

Feel or imagine that the breath is being drawn in and out
through the throat and not through the nostrils, as if it is
taking place through a small hole in the throat.
As the breathing becomes slower and deeper, gently
contract the glottis so that a soft snoring sound, like the
breathing of a sleeping baby, is produced in the throat. If
practised correctly, there will be a spontaneous contraction
of the abdomen, without any effort being made.

Keep the head and spine straight, close the eyes and relax
the whole body.
Take a deep breath in and breathe out forcefully through
the nose. Immediately afterwards breathe in with the same
force. Forceful inhalation results from fully expanding the
abdominal muscles and forceful exhalation from firm
contraction of the abdominal muscles. Do not strain.
During inhalation, the diaphragm descends and the
abdomen moves outward. During exhalation, the diaphragm moves upward and the abdomen moves inward.
The movements should be slightly exaggerated.
Continue in this manner, counting 10 breaths.
Take a deep breath in and breathe out slowly.
This is one round. Practise up to 5 rounds","This practice burns up toxins and helps balance the
doshas or humours: kapha, phlegm; pitta, bile; and vata,
wind. It is a useful practice for women during labour after
a few months of proper preparation.
Because of the rapid exchange of air in the lungs, there is
an increase in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide
into and out of the bloodstream. This stimulates the
metabolic rate, producing heat and flushing out wastes
and toxins. The rapid and rhythmic movement of the
diaphragm also massages and stimulates the visceral
organs, toning the digestive system.
Bhastrika reduces the level of carbon dioxide in the blood.
It helps to alleviate inflammation in the throat and any
accumulation of phlegm. It balances and strengthens the
nervous system, inducing peace, tranquillity and onepointedness of mind in preparation for meditation. ","Bhastrika should not be practised by
people with high blood pressure, heart disease, hernia,
gastric ulcer, stroke, epilepsy, retinal problems, glaucoma

such as asthma and chronic bronchitis, those recovering
from tuberculosis, or in the first trimester of pregnancy
are recommended to practise only under the guidance of
a competent teacher. ","Beginners may take several free breaths between
rounds so that there is no strain.
Breathing may be practised at 3 breath rates: slow, medium
and fast, depending on individual capacity.
Slow bhastrika is approximately one breath every 2 seconds,
with no undue force on inhalation or exhalation. It is like
amplified normal breathing. It is especially useful for
beginners, but may also be practised at all stages.
Medium breathing increases the speed of respiration to
approximately one breath every second.
Fast breathing means a speed of around 2 breaths per
second. Both medium and fast breathing are suitable for
intermediate and advanced practitioners.
As abdominal muscles become stronger with regular
practice, the number of respirations may be increased by 5
per month until the count of 50 respirations is attained.","Physical - on the breathing process and the physical movement of the abdomen.

carotid sinuses, which are located on the carotid arteries,
the main arteries in the neck. The simple variation exerts

circulatory and respiratory systems. Normally, a decrease
in oxygen and increase in carbon dioxide in the body leads
to an increased heart rate and heavier breathing. This
process is initiated by the carotid sinuses. By exerting
pressure on these sinuses, this tendency is prevented,
allowing for decreased heart rate and increased breath
retention. This practice produces mental relaxation,
relieving stress, anxiety and anger. It develops meditative
introversion and one-pointedness. The stimulus on the

Close the eyes and relax the whole body.
Inhale deeply through the nostrils.
Exhale fully.
Hold the breath outside.
Lean forward and press down on the knees with the palms
of the hands. Straighten the elbows and raise the shoulders,
allowing further extension of the spinal cord.
Practise jalandhara bandha, pressing the chin against the

long as you can without straining.
Then release the abdominal lock, bend the elbows and
lower the shoulders.
Raise the head and then slowly inhale.
Remain in this position until the respiration returns to
normal, then begin the next round.","Uddiyana bandha is a panacea for the abdomen. It
stimulates the function of the pancreas and liver and
strengthens the internal organs. The digestive fire is
stimulated and the abdominal organs are massaged and
toned. The adrenal glands are balanced, removing lethargy
and soothing anxiety and tension. It improves blood
circulation throughout the torso.
Uddiyana bandha stimulates the solar plexus, which has
many subtle influences on the distribution of energy
throughout the body. It creates a suction pressure which
reverses the energy flow of apana and prana, uniting them
with samana and stimulating manipura chakra.","Persons suffering from colitis, stomach
or intestinal ulcer, diaphragmatic hernia, .major abdominal
problems, high blood pressure, heart disease, glaucoma
and raised intracranial pressure should not perform this
practice. It should also be avoided during pregnancy.","Uddiyana bandha is performed with external
breath retention only.","Physical - on the abdomen and breath.

bandhas. It affects the hormonal secretions of the pineal
gland and regulates the entire endocrine system. The
degenerative and ageing processes are checked and every
cell of the body is rejuvenated. It introverts the mind prior
to meditation. When perfected, it can fully awaken prana
in the main chakras. It leads to the merger of prana, apana
and samana in manipura chakra, which is the culmination
of all pranayamas.","People suffering from high or low blood

225,JALA NETI,"A special neti lota, 'neti pof should be used. This
pot may be made of plastic, pottery, brass or any other
metal which does not contaminate the water. The nozzle
on the end of the spout should fit comfortably into the
nostril so that the water does not leak out. Even a teapot
may be used if the tip of the spout is not too large or sharp.
The water should be pure, at body temperature and
thoroughly mixed with salt in the proportion of one
teaspoonful per half litre of water. The addition of salt
ensures the osmotic pressure of the water is equal to that of
the body fluids, thereby minimizing any irritation to the
mucous membrane. A painful or burning sensation is an
indication of too little or too much salt in the water.
Stage I: Washing the nostrils
Fill the neti pot with the prepared salt water.
Stand squarely, with legs apart so that the body weight is
evenly distributed between the feet. Lean fonvard and tilt
the head to one side.
Breathe through the mouth.
Gently insert the nozzle into the uppermost nostril.
There should be no force involved.
The nozzle should press firmly against the side of the
nostril so that no water leakage occurs.
Tilt the neti pot in such a way that water runs into the
nostril and not down the face.
Keep the mouth open. Raising the elbow of the hand
which holds the neti pot helps to adjust the body position
so that the water flows out through the lower nostril.
When half the water has passed through the nostrils,
remove the nozzle from the nostril, centre the head and
let the water run out of the nose.
Remove any mucus from the nose by b1owing gently.
Tilt the head to the opposite side and repeat the process,
placing the nozzle of the Iota in the upper nostril.
After completing this process, the nostrils must be
thoroughly dried.
Stage 2: Drying the nostrils
1. Stand erect.
Close the right nostril with the right thumb and breathe
in and out through the left nostril 10 times in quick
succession, as in kapalbhati pranayama.
Repeat through the right nostril, with the left nostril closed.
Perform once more through both nostrils.
2. Bend fmward from the waist so that the trunk is
horizontal.
Repeat the same process as described above, but tilt the
head to the right, closing the right nostril.
Repeat again, tilting the head to the left and closing the
left nostril.
Finally, repeat again with the head centred, breathing
through both nostrils.Stand erect with the feet apart. Close the right nostril and
exhale forcefully while bending fotward rapidly from the
waist. Inhale normally while returning to the upright
position. Repeat 5 times.
Repeat with the right nostril open and then with both
nostrils open. Do not blow the nose too hard as the
remaining water may be pushed into the ears.
If necessary, perform shashankasana for several minutes
to allow the drainage of any remaining water.","J ala neti removes mucus and pollution from the
nasal passages and sinuses, allowing air to flow without
obstruction. It helps prevent and manage respiratory tract
diseases. It helps to maintain good health of the ears, eyes
and throat.
Jala neti relieves muscular tension of the face and helps
the practitioner to maintain a fresh and youthful appear-
ance. It has a calming and soothing influence on the brain.
It alleviates anxiety, anger and depression, removes
drowsiness and makes the head feel light and fresh.
Jala neti stimulates the various nerve endings in the nose,
improving the sense of smell and the overall health of the
individual. A balance is brought about between the right
and left nostrils and the corresponding left and right brain
hemispheres, inducing a state of harmony and balance
throughout the body and mind. Most importantly, however,
neti helps to awaken ajna chakra.","People who suffer from chronic bleeding in
the nose should not do jala neti without the advice of a
competent teacher. Those who-consistently have great diffi-
culty passing water through the nose may have a structural
blockage and should seek expert advice. People prone to or
having ear infections should not do neti. During colds, flu or
sinusitis, when the nose is totally blocked, neti should be
avoided.",,"Physical - on relaxing and positioning the body,
on the flow of water through the nostrils, and on relaxed
breathing through the mouth, especially for beginners.
Spiritual - on ajna chakra.",,,,"Practitioners may suck water up the nostrils directly
from a glass or bowl. This is the original form of the
practice called vyutkrama kapalbhati, or usha paan, which
literally means 'water of the dawn'.
Other liquids may also be used instead of water for the
practice of neti. These include warm milk - dugdh neti,
warm clarified butter or ghee - ghrita neti, and yoghurt. If
oil is used instead of ghee, it must be natural and without
added chemicals. The most powerful form of neti is
practised with the midflow of one's own urine, and is known
as amaroli neti. This form is particularly useful for alleviating
inflammation of the nasal passages. Each liquid bestows a
different benefit. None of these variations should be
attempted unless instructed by a competent teacher.",
226,SUTRA NETI,"Take any comfortable standing, sitting or squatting
position.
Relax the whole body.
Tilt the head slightly back. Gently and slowly insert the
narrow end of the catheter or waxed end of the thread into
whichever nostril is flowing more freely.
As the thread is inserted, twist it so that it enters the nostril
easily. Always keep the tip pointing downward towards the
base of the nose. Never push the catheter straight up
because the nasal cavity is behind the nose, not at the top
of the nose.
When the thread reaches the back of the throat, insert the
index finger and thutnb, or the middle and index fingers,
into the mouth.
Pull the catheter or thread gently and slowly out through
the mouth, leaving a few inches of thread hanging out of
the nostril.
This action may cause retching at first, but it will become
easier with practice.
Hold each end of the sutra or catheter with the fingers.
Very slowly and gently pull it backward and fotward, no
more than 15 times on the first attempt.
Remove it slowly through the nose and repeat the process
with the opposite nostril.","The benefits are the same as for jala neti. In addition,
however, sutra neti can rectify the problem of deviated
nasal septum. If one or both nostrils are not flowing freely
due either to deformed bone or fleshy outgrowths, the
regular friction of sutra neti causes these obstructions to
disappear within a few months.","Those people who suffer from chronic
bleeding in the nose should not do sutra neti. Anyone with
nasal ulcers, polyps, or severe malformations of the nasal
septum or turbinates should first seek the advice of a yogic
or ayurvedic doctor.",,"Physical - on relaxing the body and moving the
